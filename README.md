# microauth

Microauth is a lightweight, OIDC-based, self-hosted SSO solution.

I made Microauth because I had a lot of services that needed authentication, but no existing solution met all of my requirements. I wanted something fully self contained that required virtually no setup.

# Should you use Microauth?

No. I have no clue what I'm doing.
